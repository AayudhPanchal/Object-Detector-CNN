This repository is to document the build of an Object Detection CNN similar to that used by the You Only Look Once algorithm, using Pytorch, to train the model on the KITTI dataset, adding depth estimation to the mix. 

# How to set up:
```bash
- git clone https://github.com/AayudhPanchal/Object-Detector-CNN.git
- cd Object-Detector-CNN
```
